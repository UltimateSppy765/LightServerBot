# What happens with your data:
For one thing, idc about your data. All data you authorize to access is only used temporarily to check and add you to the server using OAuth. After you're added to the server (or not added if not whitelisted), the access token is revoked automatically by the bot because the bot stores nothing and it would go unused.

Your information is completely safe while using this bot, trust me. You can literally check the [source code](https://github.com/UltimateSppy765/LightServerBot/blob/main/imports/modules/keep_alive.py){:target="_blank"} for yourself if you doubt the process.

### Have a great day in the Light server!
